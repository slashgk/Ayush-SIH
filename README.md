Project - Smart India Hackathon, 2018
I developed this android app at the Grand Finale of Smart India Hackathon, 2018. My team, BITPLASMA won the KPIT Innovation Award. 
It is basically an Ayurvedic to modern scale units converter.

It consists of the following features to achieve the same:
1. Image Recognition - Using Open Source Tesseract OCR engine and 
2. Speech to Text Converter - Using Google Speech to Text API
3. Barcode Scanner - Using Google Barcode API
4. Normal Converter

We used Django with SQLite for the database. 
Data is retrieved in the JSON format using Async Task Loader.
